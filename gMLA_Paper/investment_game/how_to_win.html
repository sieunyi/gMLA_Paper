<h2>How to earn money</h2>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li> The first part of the study consists of 4 rounds of investment choices.
For each choice, you can invest up to $1 in increments of $0.25.</li>
    <li>Money that is not invested is yours to keep</li>
    <li>You will be assigned a "success number" between 1 and 6.</li>
    <li>You will roll a virtual six-sided die.</li>
    <li>If the result of the die matches your "success number", the investment is successful. If your investment is successful, you get six times your investment, else you get nothing.</li>

<li>The probability of success is 1/6 (17%), while the probability of failure is 5/6 (83%).</li>
    <li>In the next round, you will be assigned to a new "success number" and repeat this process.</li>

</ul>
